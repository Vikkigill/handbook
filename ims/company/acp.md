# Access Control Policy

The Company Access Control Register (ACR) is the authoritative list of who can access what at a company level. It is maintained by the IMS Manager.

Access is granted on a need-to-know basis, ensuring everyone has enough information to be able to perform their role.

## General User and Network Access Control

Our access controls reflect that:
- We trust our team members to act responsibly, and to abide by the Acceptable Use Policy
- We trust our team members to access appropriate sites when using the internet
- We control unauthorised Spam or relay traffic
- We ensure there is delineation between management and user systems, where deemed necessary
- We protect commercially and personally sensitive information from unauthorised access

## Made Tech Assets Access Control
An Access Control Register is maintained by the IMS Manager. It is currently in the form of a spreadsheet. This register details what team members are allowed access to and at what level.

This register is updated each time a team member joins or leaves Made tech, or there is a relevant change in role within the company. When a team member leaves Made Tech, their record is moved to the â€˜Previous Employees', reflecting their access level at the time of leaving for the purposes of audit.
