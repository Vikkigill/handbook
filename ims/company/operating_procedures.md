# Operating procedures: Outsourcing and Supplier Management

This policy is a guide to the Operating procedures at Made Tech, as well as guidelines around outsourcing and supplier management. 

Our core activity is agile software development, both: 
- Working alongside clients to provide expertise to supplement or train their inhouse teams 
- delivering complete solutions on their behalf. 

At all times during the development cycle we follow the delivery process as detailed in [The Made Tech Way](https://github.com/madetech/way) with specific working practices agreed with the client where appropriate.

## Change Management

We use SaaS solutions to provide all our internal services so we do not need to make configuration changes apart from adding and removing users.

### Client Systems

We also support some of our clientsâ€™ systems on their behalf. Changes are typically controlled in the same way as application source code. Infrastructure management needs will typically be agreed with the client as part of a Statement of Work and/or contract.

In all instances, there will be a peer review and approval prior to the change being actioned. The client is engaged throughout the process of making changes.

## Outsourced Development

It is important we remain flexible in the way we work with our clients. This means we may be asked to work with another organisation to provide specific skills.
 - If Made Tech is the lead team, we will subcontract the other party. The contract / SoW will define how we will work together
 - If Made Tech is the subcontractor, it is the end client who will normally define the rules of engagement

## Build Standards
For more information on our Build Standards, please see our [Device Profiles Policy](company/device_profiles.md)

## Virus Controls
 - We use antivirus software to protect Made Tech systems.
 - Our MDM system pushes Avast AV antivirus to Macbooks. For team members who use Linux devices, we install Sophos as the preferred antivrus software. Our MDM system reports on the status of the AV on all laptops, including BYOD devices. 
 - The IMS Manager monitors the device status via our MDM platform.
## System Patching
All laptop computers are patched automatically.

## Network Management and Capacity Planning
 - We monitor the status of our office WiFi via cloud based network management.
 - Production systems are hosted on cloud-based suppliers using a mix of PaaS and IaaS, where necessary making use of autoscaling features. We can very quickly provision systems and scale-up our cloud-based systems where required.

## Media Handling and Security
Please see our [Information Handling Policy](link), our [Clear Desk/Clear Screen Policy](link) and [Controlling, Classifying, and Handling Assets Policy](link) for further details

## Security of Email and Internet Access
 - Gmail is used to communicate internally and with third parties, clients and suppliers. It includes measures to prevent Spamming, Relay and Abusive Content. 
 - Made Tech ensures appropriate protection agaisnt viruses etc. is on all laptops.
 - The [Acceptable Use Policy](aup.md) sets guidelines for acceptable email usage and for ensuring security of E-mail. 

## Disposal of IT Equipment Policy
Damaged or un-usable devices are disposed of securely in line with the WEEE directive.
All devices will be decommissioned by the People Team who ensures all information is removed from internal or attached storage media as part of the standard offboarding process.

## Supplier Management Policy
All our core services are cloud-based SaaS solutions such as G Suite and AWS. We assess each SaaS solution for its suitability before we buy into it, and that includes an assessment of how secure a service it is, and their stance regarding business continuity and security breaches. 

When we use SaaS solutions for the core services of the business (e.g. Slack, G Suite, GitHub), we implement a backup solution. This is to mitigate any risks relating to service provider failure, and ensures our business continuity.

We actively engage with the service to make necessary changes via a portal/dashboard. Where possible, autoscaling will occur in line with previously defined limits. If there is an issue with the service, all team members are encouraged to be proactive and raise ticket on the SaaS provider portal.
