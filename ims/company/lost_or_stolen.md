# What To Do When Your Device is Lost or Stolen

The first thing you should do if your device is lost or stolen is report the incident to the CSO or IMS Manager as soon as possible.

For Team members using the standard build of Made Tech device, we are able to use MDM (mobile device management) software to remotely wipe data from your device. 

Those who are not using a Made Tech issued device should consult the [BYOD policy](byod.md).

## Reporting a device as stolen to the police
When reporting to the police you should provide them with the following details:
 - Office address
 - Your address
 - Where and when you believe you lost or had it stolen
 - The relevant device details from Charlie HR: make, model and serial number
 - Any location info available in Find My iPhone/Mac

Once the report of the stolen device is made, please make a note of the crime reference number and update the IMS manager.
