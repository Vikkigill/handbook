# Onboarding Policy
This policy acts as a guide to Made Tech's onboarding process.

## The Policy

The Head of People conducts an onboarding session with all new starters. This includes:
 - Issuing the new starter with their device (unless they have opted for BYOD)
 - Registering that device on Charlie HR
 - Setting up BPSS checks for the new starter (where required)
 - Ensuring the new starter is set up on, and understands, our internal SaaS solutions, such as (but not limited to): Harvest, Slack, G Suite, etc.
 - Using The Made Tech Handbook (including the IMS overview) to familiarise the new starter with Made Tech’s aims, objectives and procedures in general. 
 - Setting up following sessions with relevant departments (such as Operations, or Sales) and introducing the new starter to their line manager.

### Probation Period
There is a probation period of three or six months, depending on circumstances. 
 - During this time, the new joiner will have a one-to-one with their line manager every two weeks. 
 - At the end of the probation period the joiner will be informed they have: passed their probation, it will be extended, or they have not passed, in which case they will be released.
 - Charlie HR is used to track an individual’s progress through their probation period. 

### Exit Interviews
Exit interviews are offered to all employees leaving Made Tech’s employment. These interviews are carried out by someone other than the line manager with the results being fed back to enable Made Tech to address any issues within its control.
