# Grievances and Disciplinary Policy

This policy outlines how we process formal grievances and how we undertake disciplinary procedures. This policy applies to all team members at Made Tech, employees and contractors. 

## The Policy

### Feedback
For the purposes of our IMS guidance, this section will not cover policies and processes around feedback. As a company we encourage, empower, and educate our team to proactively provide valuable, constructive, and articulate feedback on all aspects of the organisation. Guidelines around feedback can be found in the [Welfare Section](link) of the Handbook. 

### Formal Grievance Procedure

Grievances are concerns, problems or complaints that employees raise with their employer. We follow the Acas Code of Practice on Grievance Procedures.

If a grievance cannot be settled informally, the employee should raise it formally with the Head of People, using the formal grievance procedure.

- Step 1: Employee should write an email to the Head of People setting out the details of the grievance and how it might be resolved.
- Step 2: Made Tech will arrange a formal meeting to discuss the issue as soon as possible. The employee has the right to bring a companion* with them. Made Tech may choose to adjourn the meeting to investigate the issue further.
- Step 3: Made Tech will decide what action, if any, to take. The decision, and a full explanation of how the decision was reached, will be communicated to the employee in writing and without unreasonable delay.
- Step 4: The employee then has the right to appeal the decision. The appeal will be heard as quickly as possible, and efforts will be made to involve impartial members of staff or staff who have not already been a part of the grievance procedure. The outcome of the appeal will be communicated in writing.

\*Companion can include a paid official of a trade union, a lay trade union official that can provide evidence of experience in these matters, or a colleague. In certain circumstances we may also allow representatives from other organisations if particularly relevant to the grievance such as Citizens Advice Bureau.

The [Code of Practice](http://www.acas.org.uk/publications) can be found on the Acas website.

## Disciplinary Procedure
While we always prefer to handle minor misdemeanours in an informal â€“ grown up - way, we have a disciplinary procedure in place which will be invoked in the unusual event that a member of staff breaches any of our Company policies or performs (or assists in) an illegal or immoral activity.
