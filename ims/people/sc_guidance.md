## Security Clearance Guidance

Certain changes in personal circumstances require you to notify the government. This applies if you: 
 - Marry / form a Civil Partnership / divorce / dissolve a civil partnership or have a new or change of partner and where you have a change of co-resident (e.g. housemate).
 - Receive a Police caution, are arrested, refused bail, or convicted of an offence (other than minor road traffic offences).
 - Are subject to any type of insolvency proceedings; court repayment plan; or experience financial difficulties.
 
In these circumstances, you must inform the Head of People who will assist you to notify the relevant authority.
