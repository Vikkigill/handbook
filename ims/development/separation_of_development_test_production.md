# Separation of Development, Test, and Production environments

This policy acts as a guide to our development practices and the separation of separation of development, Test, and production environments

## The Policy
Separate, segregated, testing and development networks and systems are created on the appropriate cloud platform for the client's needs to provide safe environments for systems to be built and changes can be evaluated and tested with no danger of impacting production systems. 

For more information on how we control client data during this process, please see our [Control of Data Policy](link).
