# System Planning and Acceptance

This policy provides a guide on development practices around system planning. 

## The Policy
We use advance planning and preparation to ensure the availability of adequate capacity and resources. As the systems we implement and support are cloud based, the systems themselves are often configured to auto scale to respond to demand.

### System Selection
A Product Assessment must be completed when selecting a new or upgraded system or service. The product assessment should assess the security characteristics of the product and how well they fit the clientâ€™s needs.

### System Acceptance
 - Standard acceptance criteria are employed and are defined at the design stage. 
 - We carry out vulnerability testing on the infrastructure. We also allow clients to run their own penetration / vulnerability tests under pre-agreed conditions.
 - We promote a Test-driven Development approach at Made Tech and will typically write automated acceptance and unit tests prior to writing application code to provide ongoing assurance that the application code runs as initially intended.
