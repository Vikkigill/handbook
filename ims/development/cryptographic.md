# Cryptographic Policy

The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance on the selection and use of cryptographic algorithms. It applies to all Made Tech employees and contractors. 

## The Policy
- Cryptographically enabled protocols are the default method of access for systems (e.g. SSH for remote administration access, HTTPS for accessing web-based control panels)
- Company laptops have encrypted hard drives with a master key being available in the MDM system in the event the laptop owner becomes unavailable at short notice
- Communication with all Made Tech cloud-based tools occurs over the HTTPS protocol
- Sensitive credentials should be managed with a key management solution such as HashiCorp Vault or Amazon KMS
- Made Tech provide the 1Password password manager for all employees to securely store encrypted passwords and secrets
